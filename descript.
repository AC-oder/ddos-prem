This is a .exe file that will show you everyhing you need to know about a server.

Server Platforms That Work
- Discord
- Minecraft
- Rust
- FiveM

Put the server IP in the part where it says IP and let it do its thing. 
If it is a discord server, put the invite link where it says d.inv.
Once it does that, a menu will appear. Here you can kick, ban, get IP, shut server down and more!
